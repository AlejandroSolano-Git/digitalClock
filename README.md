# digitalClock
A simple digital clock with neon font and flickering effects.

A deeper examination of this project is a digital clock that relies on the user's timezone. The CSS is designed off of softer colors, almost like the colors of a neon city at night. The clock text is designed to bounce off this idea, with a neon element that flickers, almost like a street light with a light blue hew. The hours, minutes, and seconds have labels associated with them to avoid confusion.
